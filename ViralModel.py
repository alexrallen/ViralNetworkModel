#Abstract class for a viral model
#Will contain calculations that occur between nodes
#Needs to be structure-agnostic

#SI model
#The suseptible vertice will count the number of infected neighbors.
#Some constant times the number of infected neighbors is the probability of changing state from S to I.


#SIR model
#The suseptible vertices will count the number of infected neighbors.
#Some constant times the number of infected neighbors is the probability of changing state from S to I.
#Same process for I to R
